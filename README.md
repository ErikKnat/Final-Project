This is my final code. I attempted to make a few changes on Monday 12/15 and Tuesday 12/16, but could no longer import the data as I had the couple weeks before.
I kept receiving a Gateway Timeout Error and filenotfound.
I was planning on including code to identify clusters in the linear regression, but could never get the data imported correctly to so.
